A track containing regions.

On the far left is a track header with the track name and a drop down where one can pick instrument (square wave, sine wave and triangle wave).

By tapping outside a region, a region is added. If tapping a region, a MIDI-editor is opened (defined in app/editor). The midi notes is visible on an un-opened region as well as gray boxes.

A region may be dragged along the track to move it. The dragged notes snaps to the beats.
